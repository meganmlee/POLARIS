; PDDL domain: PushO with obstacles (tabletop manipulation)
; =============================================================================
; TABLE: Grid of regions r_m_n (m=row, n=column). Goal = one of these regions. Do not attempt to target regions with columns larger than 7 as they are outside the robot's reachable workspace.
; DISK SIZE: The disk is ~3x the diameter of an obstacle cube (~1.5-tile radius).
;   push_disk requires not just the destination cell to be (clear ?to), but ALL cells
;   within 1 tile of the entire disk path to be free. Clear every obstacle adjacent to
;   the planned push_disk corridor BEFORE executing push_disk steps.
; OBSTACLES: 10 obstacle cubes (obstacle0..obstacle9). Each obstacle has a SIZE relative to
;   the gripper/end-effector:
;   - (pickable ?b): obstacle is SMALLER than gripper → use PICK and PLACE to move
;     it out of the way.
;   - (push-only ?b): obstacle is BIGGER than gripper → cannot pick; use PUSH_CUBE
;     to push it one cell out of the way.
;   When picking and placing the obstacles, try to move them a bit farther away from other obstacles as they may interfere with each other.
; The planner must figure out from (pickable obstaclei) and (push-only obstaclej) which
; action to use for each obstacle. Main objective: get the disk to the goal region.
